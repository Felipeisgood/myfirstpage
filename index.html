  <P>
    In decision theory and general systems theory, <STRONG><U><A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset" TARGET="_BLANK" TITLE="MINDSET">a mindset</A></U></STRONG> is a set of assumptions, methods, or notions held by one or more people or groups of people.[citation needed] A mindset can also be seen as arising out of a person's world view or philosophy of life.[1]

    A mindset may be so firmly established that it creates a powerful incentive within these people or groups to continue to adopt or accept prior behaviors, choices, or tools.[citation needed] The latter phenomenon is also sometimes described as mental inertia, "groupthink", and it is often difficult to counteract its effects upon analysis and decision making processes.

    In cognitive psychology, a mindset represents the cognitive processes activated in response to a given task (French, 2016).</P>
